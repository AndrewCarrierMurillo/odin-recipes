RECIPES 

Hi everyone! This is my first project with The Odin Project. In this project I will build a basic HTML website that houses pages with a different recipe on each page. 


Skills that are covered in this project:

1. Creating and maintaining a repository on Github. 
2. Creating the boilerplate HTML structure. 
3. Using basic elements to build a webpage, including paragraphs, headers, and links. 
4. Linking images to the website.
